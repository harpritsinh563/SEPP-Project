Respected Teachers,
There are 2 folders here 1 is mytest which contains all the stuff done during lab hours(SP) for learning purpoe.
Another folder is PROJECT folder which contains the actual project for SEM-4 SEPP subject.
Project title : E-Commerce Website
There are some issues from bhagat's pc while pushing into main branch so we have a created a seperate branch for him called 'bhagat'
Have removed JS files from static of lab testing folder because that was of no use and in github it was showing our project was built 93% of JS 
Thank You
